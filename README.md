# UI

This repository contains react components that we are using in school projects.

## Install

```
npm install @zsk-poznan/ui
```

## Motivation

It's nice when related programs use common design system. If we will have one
place that will contain all components it would be easier to then reuse already
written code in new projects. Thanks to that it will be also easier in the
future to change ui in all projects. That's why we are creating this library.

## Demo

[Here](https://www.figma.com/file/ywtwzYMheRo2nazaQzL8wX/ZSK?node-id=0%3A1) you
can take a look at what we are planning to do!

## Contributing

Right now I am working on project setup and deployment process, but if you're
willing to help you could create a component in `/src/components` based on
project in Figma (see above).

Please open an issue if you want to do so, so I get mentioned.

## MVP

As the main goal we want to move all components from
[zastepstwa](https://github.com/zsk-poznan/zastepstwa)
and support light mode.
